# Issues
This repository has no code. It is used as a [public issue tracker](https://github.com/abb-iss/issues/issues) for our private repositories. Issues for our public repositories (such as [SrcML.NET](https://github.com/abb-iss/SrcML.NET) can also be reported here -- they will simply be migrated to the appropriate issue tracker during triage.

Our projects are managed in [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/). Issues will have one or more associated stories in Pivotal. Once completed, the issue will be closed & accepted in Pivotal before closing the issue.
